# LiquiNFT on Zilliqa - Fractionalised NFT ownership

LiquiNFT contracts allow users to lock up their NFT in the LiquiNFT contract, which then creates a new fungible token representing fractional ownership of the NFT. The number of fractional shares created is an input variable in the relevant transition and can be defined by the user.

To unlock (redeem) the NFT collateral, all fungible token shares must first be burnt - by calling the redeem transition in the relevant smart contracts.

See LiquiNFT-FungibleToken.scilla and LiquiNFT-Fungible-Factory.scilla for our codebase, under the Reference Folder. Our contracts have been deployed on the Zilliqa developer testnet.


# How does it work?

Given that a fungible token is flexible such that it can be exchanged for another of its kind without losing value, a smart contract can be deployed to generate ZRC2 tokens linked to an indivisible ZRC1 NFT. This way, anyone who holds any of the ZRC2 tokens generated can own a percentage of the rare and valuable NFT.
This is how fractional ownership of an NFT can be created, and the smart contract can secure the data that differentiates the fractional NFT from other NFTs. This idea can also be applied on any blockchain network that supports smart contracts and NFTs such that the NFT is locked in a smart contract on the blockchain and ownership of the NFT is represented by multiple fungible tokens whose supply is governed by the smart contract.‚Äù
So, in simple terms, the non-fungible ZRC1 tokens are broken up into fungible ZRC2 tokens, which allow any buyers to own a portion. This is both a benefit to buyers and curators.

# Why Fractional Ownership?

So this allows lots of people to have part ownership thus being part of the club and making some sweet profits from a future sale, all without having to spend millions. A buyer chooses how much they want to put up and in return they are given a percentage of shares which represents ownership.
This is the big difference between the digital and physical world. You could never break up the Mona Lisa and divide ownership without having an incomplete piece of work. However, we can do this with a CryptoPunk and many more.

More documentation coming soon.

# Relevant Transitions and Procedures

LiquiNFT-FungibleToken.scilla caputres the business logic of fractionalising the NFT.

1. The *Deposit_and_mint* transition handles conversion of ZRC1 to ZRC2 fractional shares. It first calls the *AuthorizedDepositNFT* procedure to approve & transfer the relevant NFT from the user to the contract. This requires the NFT contract address and the TokenID as params.

The transition then calls the *AuthorizedMint* procedure to mint the requested amount of ZRC2 Fungible Tokens, representing fractional ownership in the NFT.

2. The *Burn_and_redeem* transition allows the collateral NFT to be redeemed, if and only if one user has ALL the fungible fractional tokens (i.e. complete ownership of the collateral NFT). Otherwise, the transaction reverts.

# Contributing
1. Review [ZRC-0](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC/blob/master/zrcs/zrc-0.md).
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your ZRC to your fork of the repository. There is a template ZRC [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC/blob/master/zrcs/zrc-1.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request to [Zilliqa's ZRC repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final ZRC. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new ZRC and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to header` with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the ZRC as a whole.

If your ZRC requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that ZRC as follow: `assets/zrc-X` (for zrc X). When linking to an image in the ZRC, use relative links such as `../assets/zrc-X/image.png`.

When you believe your ZRC is ready to progress past the 'Draft' phase, you should go to our [Zilliqa Official Discord](https://discord.gg/XMRE9tt) server and ask to have your issue added to the next community dev call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the ZRC editors will update the state of your ZRC to 'Approved'.

# ZRC Status
1. **Draft** - a preliminary version of the ZRC that is not yet ready for submission.
2. **Ready** - a preliminary version of the ZRC that is ready for review by a wide audience.
3. **Approved** - a finalized version of the ZRC that has been in the 'Ready' state for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
4. **Implemented** - a finalized version of the ZRC that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release.
